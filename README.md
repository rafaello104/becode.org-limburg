# Webpage: Becode.org/limburg
Find the website here: [https://rafaello104.github.io/website-limburg](https://rafaello104.github.io/becode.org-limburg/)

## Design
We're going for a contemporary design that will outlay the quality of BeCode Limburg as well as work well with the original website.
We aim to work with the original design, not collide with it whilst at the same time, trying to make it our own.


## ToDo:
### Header section:
- Add Welcome to BeCode Limburg as a title to the page in the middle above the flipclock
- Under the title a description, defining the meaning of the flipclock
- under the description, the flipclock itself
- buttons added somewhere to sign up
- both subcolumns removed

### Intro section:
- remove second timer and right column
- first paragraph in the intro section becomes the second
- the first paragraph speaks about becode limburg now, it will also contian a link to the calendar and the sign up page
- the second paragraph speaks about becode in general
- a third paragraph will show the values as they do on [https://www.becode.org/register/register_nl.html](https://www.becode.org/register/register_nl.html)
- then the end of the paragraph

### Email issues:
Once this is done, check if the email issues persist on the DNS side of things, if they do, send a pm to lenny to doublecheck 
the dns settings have been changed. <br/>
If they have: contact TransIp to doublecheck the mail server registration process and if it succeeded.


### Team settings:
- Resize the pictures of the team to be max-width of 350px and then re-compress the images
